# ruby_project

Take-home technical assignment to demonstrate skills with Ruby.

The project read JSON files (one for a list of companies and the other for a list of users) and applied some business logic to update users' data. It also added a list of emailed users and a list of not-emailed users for each company. Then it creates an output file with the new data.

## Dependencies

## Usage

The JSON files for users(users.json) and companies(companies.json) must be in the lib folder.

The output.txt file will be created in the files folder.
